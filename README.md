# 🧠 Domain Expert AI Model - Built with PartyRock & Amazon Bedrock

This project was created as part of the **Udacity x AWS course**: *Introducing Generative AI with AWS*. It showcases how to build a simple, no-code **AI assistant** that acts as a domain expert in a specific field.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal was to build a Generative AI-powered app that answers questions and provides insights like a human expert in a chosen domain. This was done using **PartyRock**, powered by **Amazon Bedrock**, to connect with foundation models like Claude or Amazon Titan.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **PartyRock by AWS** (No-code app builder)
- **Amazon Bedrock** (LLM backend)
- **Pre-trained Foundation Models**
- Prompt Engineering (for domain-specific responses)

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Acts as a knowledgeable assistant in your chosen domain
- 💬 Accepts user input (questions or topics)
- 📝 Gives intelligent, domain-specific responses
- 🌐 Hosted on PartyRock with a public or private link

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Field** – User types a question or prompt
2. **LLM Widget** – Uses custom prompt to act as a domain expert
3. **Response Field** – Displays the expert’s answer
4. Optional: Add summaries, images, or related suggestions

## 📚 Use Case Example

*Domain:* Fitness Coach  
*What it does:* Gives workout plans, diet tips, and motivation based on user input.

## 📝 How to Try It

1. Visit [PartyRock](https://partyrock.aws) and sign in with your AWS account
2. Clone or remix the app using the shared link (if public)
3. Customize the prompt, layout, or widgets as needed

## 📈 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned:
- How to design and prompt an LLM for domain-specific tasks
- How to build functional AI apps without code
- How generative AI can be applied in real-world scenarios
